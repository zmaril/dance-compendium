# Language for Talking About Partner Dancing 

This page contains a small amount of language I've been thinking through for talking and writing about partner dancing.  

For a while now, I've tried to write down notes after classes about what I
learned and I never felt like I had the vocabulary or notation to really fully
describe what I wanted to say. I'm using physics terms to talk what's going and
taking a mathematical approach to building up from scratch useful terms with
definitions. These page was extracted from some other notes I had written up
about [connections in Sensual Bachata](/bachata/notes/connection). 

Bolded and capitalized words below are terms that I will use that have a
specific meaning to me as described below. 

### Basics 
* When we **Partner Dance**, we have  **Music** playing and two
**Dancers**, a **Leader** and a **Follower**. 
* Each **Dancer** has a **Posture** at any given moment, whether dancing alone
  or with someone, of how they hold their body. Here, **Posture** goes beyond
  just standing or sitting up straight but is used to describe how a **Dancer**
  has every part of their body arranged. 
* Each genre or style of **Music** has a set of **Conventions** associated with
  it about how the **Dancers** should dance together when a **Song** of that
  **Music** genre of music is what they are dancing to.


### Connection I
* Every **Dancer** has a
**Connection** with the world around them that allows them to dance and do
certain **Movements**.
* Each **Dancer**, whether a **Leader** or a **Follower**,
starts with a **Connection** with **The Floor** as well as a **Connection** to the **Music**. 
* The **Connection** with **The Floor** is through the **Dancer's** feet acting
  as the **Point of Contact** typically. 
* The **Connection** with the **Music** is through the **Dancer's** ears (and whole body if the **Music** is loud enough). 
* The two **Dancer's** in a **Partner Dance** also have a **Connection** with
* **Physical Connection** is the various **Points of Contact** between a **Dancer's** body and something else.
* **Visual Connection** is what each of the **Dancers** can see in the world around them and also what each of the **Dancers** choose to show one another. 

### Physics I
* Through the **Dancer's** various **Physical Connections** to the rest of the world,
  they find a **Balance** that allows them to maintain their body in their
  desired **Posture**. 
* **Balance** is the distribution of the **Dancer's** weight across the various
  **Points of Contact** that they currently have available to them through their **Connections**.  
* A **Center of Gravity** exists at all times for every **Dancer**. It is a point in space that represents where a **Dancer** must **Balance** around and support their weight through. If a **Dancer** cannot support their **Center of Gravity** through their **Balance**, they will lose their **Posture** and have a full body **Connection** with **The Floor**. 
* A **Dancer** can move their **Center of Gravity** around by changing their **Balance** and **Posture**. 

### Frame I 
* Each **Dancer** is applying physical **Force** to one another through the various **Contact Points** of their **Physical Connection**. 
* The **Frame** is the collection of **Forces** that the **Dancers** are applying to one another. 
* Through the **Physical Connection** between the **Dancers**, the **Leader** sets the **Frame** and the **Follower** fills the frame by applying force back into the **Frame**.

### Dance I
* During a **Partner Dance**, each **Dancer** has an **Orientation** towards the other **Dancer** irrespective of their **Posture** that describes how their body is positioned relative to the other person. The **Dancers** could be **Oriented** so that they were standing face to face to each other, side to side, or back to back, with any number of different **Postures** being taken by each **Dancer** without changing the **Orientation**. 
* A **Position** during a **Partner Dance** is when a **Leader** and a **Follower** have a specific **Orientation** to each other, a specific **Connection** and **Frame** between the two of them, and each their own specific **Posture**, **Balance**, and **Center of Gravity**.  
* A **Movement** is anything that changes the **Position** of the **Dancers**, typically initiated by the **Leader** and lead through the **Connection** between the two **Dancers**.

### Physics II 
TODO find a good spot to introduce **Force** earlier as well as the concept of forces adding subtracting together
* When a **Force** is applied to an object for any amount of time, then
  **Acceleration** occurs in the the direction of the **Force** and the
  **Velocity** of that object begins to increase in that direction. 
* Once a object has **Velocity**, then that object also has **Momentum**, which
  indicates where and how the body will move over time if the **Force**
  generating the **Acceleration** is removed. 
* Accordingly, the body as a whole and each body part of each **Dancer** has a
  certain **Velocity** and **Acceleration**. 
* **Linear Momentum** is how quickly and how much an something will travel through space. 
* **Angular Momentum** is how quickly and how much something will rotate in place. 
* A **Moment** in a **Partner Dance** is a particular point in time when the
  **Dancers** have a certain **Position** as well as each having a certain **Velocity** and **Acceleration**. 

## Frame II 
* When all of **Forces** in the **Frame** add together and don't balance out, **Acceleration** and **Movement** of the dancers is created in that direction. 
* When the **Forces** of the **Frame** are all in the same direction, then the **Movement** will be a **Linear Acceleration** with resulting **Linear Momentum** propelling the **Dancer** in that direction. 
* When the **Forces** of the **Frame** oppose one another by being equal in size and pointed into the **Follower**, that creates **Compression** within the **Follower** without any change in **Acceleration**.  
* When the **Forces** of the **Frame** oppose one another by being equal in size and pointed away from the **Follower**, that creates **Stretching** within the **Follower** without any change in **Acceleration**.  
* When the **Forces** of the **Frame** are **Orthogonal** to the **Follower's** **Center of Gravity**, that creates **Rotation** of the **Follower** and **Angular Momentum**. 
* Any of these **Forces** can exist within the same **Moment**, with the locus of the **Force** being on the **Dancers** as a whole or body parts of a particular **Dancer**. 
* When the **Forces** of the **Frame** switch between creating **Compression** and **Stretching**, a feeling of **Elasticity** is created. 

### Dance II 

* A **Pattern** is a sequence of **Movements** that has the **Dancers** progress through a sequence of different **Positions**.
* A **Step** is a **Pattern** that starts and ends with the same **Position**, so it can be done back to back forever. 
* A **Song** is the specific **Music** that is playing at a given moment. 
* The **Beat** for a **Song** is the pace at which the **Song** moves. Metaphorically, it's the pulse of a heartbeat in the song.
* Each **Song** has a **Beat** and sometimes more than one as the tempo might change during the song. 
* Being **On Beat** means that the **Movements** the **Dancers** are doing have key moments in the movement that match the **Beat** of the **Song**. 

### Connection II 
* A **Grounding Connection** is any connection you have with **The Floor**. It
  will always be there and support you no matter how much weight you want to put
  on it. You can put 100% of your weight into this without losing **Balance**. 
* An **Informing Connection** is one through which the **Lead** only conveys
  their intent to the follower about which moves to do next. After you move past
  being a beginner, a right hand turn out of a basic step is lead through an
  **Informing Connection** in Salsa. An **Informing Connection** does not change
  the **Balance** or **Center of Gravity** of the **Follower** directly, but
  does so indirectly by giving a signal through the **Modification** of the
  **Posture** of the **Follower** to do a certain **Movement**. 
* A **Stabilizing Connection** is one where the **Lead** offers stability
  through the **Connection** that helps the **Follower** maintain their
  **Balance** and **Center of Gravity**. For intermediates, this would come into
  play when a couple starts doing double spins in Salsa or some of the Off Axis
  turns in Zouk. This **Movement** should mostly come from the **Followers**
  prep and balance, but it's often important for the **Lead** to offer both
  extra power and stability to the **Follower** through their connection. The
  **Leader** is stabilizing the **Center of Gravity** of the **Follower**,
  changing their **Balance** so that **Center of Gravity** might remain the
  same. 
* A **Load-bearing Connection** is one in which a significant portion of the
  **Followers** weight is transferred through the **Connection** and onto the
  **Leader**. If the **Leader** were to remove their support, the **Follower**
  would not be able to maintain their **Balance** alone with that specific
  **Posture** and they would start to fall. Doing a lift, dip or lean takes
  a solid **Load-bearing connection**. Although it's typically a **Leader**
  supporting a **Follower**, [a classic counter example is the leans done in
  Cuban Son](https://youtu.be/gsKQalDu4VU?t=232). 
* Lastly, a **Modifying Connection** is when the **Leader** modifies the
  **Follower's** **Center of Gravity** directly. This means shifting the
  **Follower's** **Posture**, **Balance** and **Center of Gravity** all at once. 

### Conventions 1 
* **Conventions** are commonly and broadly agreed upon ways of acting and moving before, during and after a **Dance**. 
* Some **Conventions** are shared among most social **Dances**, for example, one person should ask another person if they want to dance together instead of just assuming they do and sweeping them away to the floor. 
* Some **Conventions** are put in place arbitrarily to make the dance work, like how certain dance styles have steps start with moving the left foot while other dance styles prefer starting with the right. Can't be both at the same time, have to pick one, might as well be either one.
* Some **Conventions** are in place for safety reasons, for example, the **Follower** should not dip themselves as it can take the **Lead** by surprise and they might not be able to get a **Load Bearing Connection** in place in time before the **Follower** hits **The Floor**. 
* Some **Conventions** are only in place for a small amount of dances, such as in Salsa where a **Follower** should only feel obligated to leave their hand someplace for 8 counts of the beat if a **Lead** is not otherwise connected with the hand. 
* Some **Conventions** are in place to create a pleasant atmosphere, such as don't stop and walk away from the dance in the middle of the song if one isn't enjoying dancing with the other person. 
* Some **Conventions** supersede others, such as it's okay for somebody to walk away from the dance if the other person has offended or hurt them in some way. 
* Some **Conventions** differ greatly between different dance scenes, such as what constitutes close contact between dancers as well as how many songs a couple should dance together in a row (a couple for Salsa and Bachata and upwards of 5 or 7 for Zouk). 
* Generally, one should not assume close contact is allowable or preferred without some indication from the other person they are dancing with. 
* Breaking a **Convention** may have repercussions during the dance as well as socially. 
* Some **Conventions** can be broken more easily and freely than others. 
* Being Un**conventional** can be good but mostly only if everyone knows you can follow **Conventions** without a problem and the other people involved are okay with that **Convention** being broken.
