This is a nice pattern from the [Bachata Scientists YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheBachataScientists). Strings together some Bachata Sensual moves in a cool way. The twist exit is tough to get right, so I'm breaking it down here into sequence charts of movements. 


### Prepping for a Cambre 

The lead steps forward and preps the follower with a big breath up over 3 counts.

* The follower steps back with their right foot while twisting their right shoulder back.
