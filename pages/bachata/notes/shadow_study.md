# The Bachata Shadow Realm 

The goal of this page is to find every way to get into and out of Shadow
Position as well as better understand all the stuff you can do while you are in
the [Shadow Realm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8mm2ZXWIGg). I try and use
this [language](http://localhost:3000/fundamentals/notes/language), even though
that language isn't quite done. 

## Introduction
To start with, the Shadow Position is when the leader is behind the follower.
The follower cannot see the leader unless they turn their head or rotate around
and leave the Shadow Position. Although some of the typical connections between
the two dancers aren't possible, any connection that is comfortable is allowable
in Shadow position, including some that aren't comfortable in the Face to Face
position. 

So, we're going to call it Shadow Position when the leader is behind the
follower, Reverse Shadow Position when the follower is behind the leader and
Face to Face when the leader and follower are facing one another. 

What this page is focused on is the transition between the different positions
above and exploring what is possible in each position. The following is a [state
diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram) about the transitions and
connections between these three positions. _Someday, I will get it to draw lines
that don't look drunk, but that day is not today._

## Journeying to the Shadow Realm 

So, let's start with the big yellow boxes containing the smaller boxes. Each big
box represents the timing that the lead is on for each position and groups
positions with the same timings together. In Face to Face, the lead follows
their regular timing, denoted as "Lead's Timing" on top of the big box. The lead
moves in the same cardinal directions as the follower while moving in a
different relative direction than the lead. Specifically, the lead moves to
their left on 1 while the follower moves to their right on 1, and both of them
go West (if the direction the lead is first facing is considered North). 

When entering the Shadow and Reverse Shadow Positions, the lead has entered the
Shadow Realm and immediately encounters a problem. Because one of the dancers
has turned around to face the opposite direction, the default relative
directions of the basic step no longer go in the same cardinal direction for
both dancers. On 1, the follower will want to go to their right, while the lead
will want to go to their left on 1. This is when most leads run into trouble
when first learning the Shadow Position.

A disconnect happens here because the lead will try to start moving their frame
to the left on 1 while the follower expects to be moving to the right on 1. I
don't follow as much as I like, but in my conversations with people who do
follow typically, they say that they don't like shadow position because of this
disconnect between the cardinal directions that each person expects to go. If
the lead isn't mindful, the follower has to switch their expectations around
their own timing and balance, which is hard to follow accurately in a responsive
manner during a social dance.

My general rule is that the follower is never wrong, everything is the lead's
fault but a good lead is always right. It's too hard for the follower to switch
timing, and since they are never wrong, leads shouldn't expect them to be able
to switch and it's the lead's fault if the follow trips up over a timing switch.
So, to be a good lead, we should find a way to lead this right and modify our
behavior instead.

When we enter the Shadow Realm, we need to transition our own timing as lead's
over to the follower's timing. There's a couple ways of doing this that we will
get into later and the way to know when you need to transition timing as a lead
is whenever you cross between the big yellow boxes. 

There's three implications to this rule about crossing between boxes that are important to call out here: 
1. Whenever a lead switches from Face to Face over to Shadow or Reverse Shadow,
   the lead needs to switch their timing to match the follower's expectations.
2. Whenever a lead switches from Shadow or Reverse Shadow back over to Face to Face,
   the lead needs to switch their timing back over to lead's timing, again to
   meet the follower's expectations. The box crossing rule hits both you coming
   to and leaving from the Shadow Realm.
3. Whenever a lead switches directly between Shadow and Reverse Shadow, the lead
   does not need to change their timing. There is no box crossing, and so those
   transition steps we will talk about later do not need to happen. If you want
   to be fancy, you can do something like step-tap-step-tap out of it and then
   back into it immediately with more step-tap-step-tap after you do a quick
   Face to Face move.

With all that, we understand the implications for the timing of each dancer when
getting into, journeying through and getting out of the Shadow Realm when we are
partner dancing.


## Transitioning to the Shadow Realm 

Now that we know how the timing works, let's talk about how the orientation of
the dancers to one another changes when transitioning to and from the Shadow
Realm. 

Here's a small part of that graph we saw above. Again, please excuse the car
crash of lines in the graph below.

{% mermaid %}

    subgraph Lead's Timing
    A 
    end
{% /mermaid %}

We see the big yellow boxes in here denoting the timing for the lead. We
also see the small blueish boxes that represent the positions themselves. What I
want to focus on now is the label for the line between the two positions, the
text in the gray box that reads "0.5 rotations follow".  

That text means that to transition from Face to Face to Shadow position, then
the follower needs to turn around by doing a movement that results in them
rotating half way around from their original position. When Shadow position is
first taught, the instructor typically has the lead do something like the following: 

* Start out Face to Face with a social connection between the dancers, connected through the hands.
* Do four counts of the basic, while prepping the follower for a turn to their left. 
* On 5, the lead turns the follower inside, with the follower rotating towards
   their left shoulder. The lead keeps their right arm at the follower's waist
   level and the left arm up above the follower's head. The lead is also
   stepping once to the right. 
* On 6, the lead finds the follower's left side with their right arm and uses
   that point of contact to stop the follower's rotation half way around. The
   lead taps their left foot in place next to the right. Right here is when the lead begins to enter the Shadow Realm with this tap.
* On 7, the lead pushes the follower back to the lead's left and then takes a
   step to the lead's left as well. The follower isn't doing a basic or anything
   in this moment, but they have still maintained their timing and likely
   haven't noticed the lead has switched theirs as the follower has oriented to
   face away from the lead.
* On 8, the lead and the follower are back where they started, having moved
   back to the left after the half rotation, with both of them doing a tap with
   their right foot. 
* On 1, the lead and follower step to their right with their right foot and
  begin exploring dancing in the Shadow Realm.

Up until now, we haven't talked about how the lead should change their timing
just that they should. There are multiple ways for the lead to change their
timing, and we get into that later, but a good way to start with is to do a step
tap step tap sequence. This sequence skips one weight change and puts the lead
on the same foot as the follower. To get out of the Shadow Realm, another half
rotation and step tap step tap is all you need. 

So that's it, that's the Shadow Realm. You know how to get into it, you know how
to get out of it, and you should be an expert in all things shadowy. Read the
rest of that first big chart up above and it should all make sense. Thanks for reading!
Bye! 

_Just kidding_. There's a lot more here that we can explore. 

## Spins and Orientation Arithmetic 

What is the difference between leading someone through two spins instead of just
one spin? What about three spins instead of one spin? A dozen spins perhaps? A
spin for every grain of sand on every beach, as many spins as there are stars in
the heavens, a spin for every moment between now and forever? I say, there is no
difference between any of these things when it comes to the orientation between
the dancers. If a follower wants to spin from now until forever, then that's
what I'll lead. _rip to the leads who can't spin somebody until the heat death of
the universe, but I'm [different](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/rip-but-im-different)._

Regarding orientation, the following is taken from [that language](/fundamentals/notes/language) I've been writing to talk about dance: 
> * During a **Partner Dance**, each **Dancer** has an **Orientation** towards the other **Dancer** irrespective of their **Posture** that describes how their body is positioned relative to the other person. The **Dancers** could be **Oriented** so that they were standing face to face to each other, side to side, or back to back, with any number of different **Postures** being taken by each **Dancer** without changing the **Orientation**. 

A full spin of either the lead or the follow doesn't change the orientation of
the dancers to one another. Once the spin is done, they are right back where
they started, no matter what the orientation originally was. The connection
might be different, the momentum and velocity and their balance might be
different, but their orientation to one another has not changed. 

Going further, let's say that a dancer rotating towards their right shoulder,
moving clockwise, and doing a full rotation is equal to 1 rotation. And, let's
say that a dancer rotating towards their left shoulder, moving counter
clockwise, and doing a full rotation is equal to -1 rotations. Now that we have
some numbers, we can say that the half rotation for the follower described above
as part of the transition into the Shadow Position rotation is a 0.5 rotation
for the follower. 

So, we can say that to get into the Shadow Position, the follower needs to
effectively do 0.5 rotations. That word "effectively" is doing a lot of work
though. I'll argue that if the follower were to do 1.5 rotations then they would
"effectively" be doing 0.5 rotations as far as the orientation of the dancers
was concerned at the end of the dance. If follower did 1000.5 rotations, then,
well, welcome to Shadow Position. That number in front of the decimal point
doesn't really matter when it comes to Shadow Position. 

What that would actually look in practice is up to the lead. Within the bounds
of most leads, adding on another spin or two to the move above would be
challenging but doable with some practice. The trick is learning how to signal
to the follower that the lead wants them to stop halfway around instead of going
the full way. We talk about that later on. 

All of this talk about numbers is the gateway towards something I'm calling
orientation arithmetic. Orientation arithmetic has been useful to me because it
helps me understand how the orientation changes while doing certain kinds of
moves. The basis of this arithmetic is [the modulo
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation). A good introduction
to the modoulo operation and modular arithmetic can be [found
here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic). 

When someone is rotating during partner dancing, the only time the orientation
of the dancers changes is when the remainder of the number of spins mod 1 is
nonzero. If we spin the follower 1 time, then 1 mod 1 is 0 and the orientation
has not changed. If we spin the follower 100 times, then 100 mod 1 is 0, and the
orientation has still not changed. But if we spin the follower 100.5  times,
then 100.5 mod 1 is 0.5, and we have changed from Face to Face to Shadow
Position.

Previously, we had said that 1 rotation is the clockwise turn to the right and
that -1 rotation is the counterclockwise turn to the left. The nice thing about
modular arithmetic is that -1 mod 1 is 0 as well. So giving the follower -1
rotations still doesn't change the orientation. The nicer thing about modular
arithmetic is that -0.5 mod 1 is 0.5. Taking that in rotations, it means that
the orientation of dancers is the same after the follower doing a half turn to
the left or the follower doing a half turn to the right. 

So, if we hadn't realized it yet, we have two ways to get into Shadow Position.
We can do a half turn to the left or a half turn to the right to the follower,
and if we watch our timing, we will be in Shadow Position. 

We can use these ideas to generate new moves and patterns too. A "0.5 rotation
follower" can turn into a -1.5 rotation or a 2.5 rotation if we know what we are
doing and that's a couple new, thrilling patterns generated from the diagram
above. It might be tricky to pull these many spins off, but once we start adding
things besides rotations to our arithmetic, we start getting some easier moves
that also new and fresh.

# Who's that seated at the other end of the table? 

Besides doing something like the diagram above, we can write out a table that
shows all of this same information in a different way.

TODO: make table look better 

This shows what happens when you are in certain position and then have each
person do a certain number of rotations. For example, if you are in Shadow
Position and and the leader does a half turn and the follower does a half turn,
then you are now in Reverse Shadow Position. The resulting positions that are
bolded are when you need to be mindful of switching timing back and forth. 

The last thing that is interesting about this chart is that we found a new
position thanks to all this: the Back to Back. The Back to Back is the reverse
of the Face to Face when both dancers rotate a half turn away from each other.
In Salsa I know that this can happen briefly in two different common move
patterns and I think at least one of those is something that is done in Bachata
as well. TODO: add links to videos of these. So, cool, new ways of saying the
new stuff and finding new things!
