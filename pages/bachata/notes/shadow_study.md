# A Study of the Shadow Position in Bachata 


This page is my attempt to understand how to lead and follow the Shadow position better in Bachata. 

The Shadow position is when the leader is behind the follower. The follow cannot
see the leader unless they turn their head or rotate around. Although some of
the normal connections between the two dancers aren't possible, any connection
that is comfortable is allowable in Shadow position, including some 

Spin arthimetic 
Embellishments 
Any connection you want 
Body movement 
Basic steps

(0.5 turn for follower or 0.5 turn plus translation for lead)

Write it out for quarter turns 
8 beats to transition between open basic to being in shadow
Start with open connection end with any connection  

Are those edges the same somehow?

Once you are there you can do anything you would normally do? 
Connection is restricted some 


Is connection determined by orientation? 

Is reverse shadow the same except in reverse?
