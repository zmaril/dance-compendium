# A Study of the Shadow Position in Bachata 


This page is my attempt to understand how to lead and follow the Shadow Position
better in Bachata. I try and use this
[language](http://localhost:3000/fundamentals/notes/language), even though that
language isn't quite done. The goal of this page is to find every way to get
into and out of Shadow Position as well as all the fun you can have while you
are there.

To start with, the Shadow Position is when the leader is behind the follower.
The follower cannot see the leader unless they turn their head or rotate around
and leave the shadow position. Although some of the typical connections between
the two dancers aren't possible, any connection that is comfortable is allowable
in Shadow position, including some that aren't comfortable in the face to face
position. 

So, we're going to call it Shadow Position when the leader is behind the
follower, Reverse Shadow Position when the follower is behind the leader and
Face to Face when the leader and follower are facing one another. 

What this study is focused on is the transition between the three different positions above and exploring what is possible in each position. The following is a [state diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram) about the connection between these three positions.

There's a lot going on above and my graphing skills aren't the best yet, so bear
with me. Someday I will get it to draw lines that don't look drunk.

So, let's start with the big boxes containing the smaller boxes. Each big box
represents the timing that the lead is on. In Face to Face, the lead follows
their regular timing, moving in the same cardinal directions as the follower while moving in a different relative direction than the lead (the lead moves to their left on 1 while the follower moves to their right on 1). 

In Shadow and Reverse Shadow, the lead has some choices to make. They can either go in the same cardinal directions as the follower is going to go, make the follower

8 beats to transition between open basic to being in shadow
Start with open connection end with any connection  

Are those edges the same somehow?




Once you are there you can do anything you would normally do? 
Connection is restricted some 


Is connection determined by orientation? 

Is reverse shadow the same except in reverse?
