# Overanalyzing Connections in Bachata Sensual

This page contains some thoughts I've been thinking through about how to connect
well with people when I am dancing Bachata Sensual. I'm approaching this with a
background of math and some physics, as there isn't much language out there
otherwise that I know to talk about dancing. This is focused on Bachata Sensual for now
because that is what I've been endeavouring to learn, but there's reference to
some other dances as well when it is useful. 

I'm going to define some general terms now that'll let me describe some things about
Bachata Sensual that I've noticed.

* When we **Partner Dance**, we have **Music** playing and two
**Dancers**, a **Leader** and a **Follower**. 
* Every **Dancer** has a
**Connection** with the world around them that allows them to dance and do
certain **Movements**.
* Each **Dancer**, whether a **Leader** or a **Follower**,
starts with a **Connection** with **The Floor**. 
* The **Connection** with **The Floor** is through the **Dancer's** feet acting
  as the **Point of Contact**. 
* The two **Dancer's** in a **Partner Dance** also have a **Connection** with
  one another through various **Points of Contact** between the two of them.
* Each **Dancer** has a **Posture** at any given moment, whether dancing alone
  or with someone, of how they hold their body. Here, **Posture** goes beyond
  just standing or sitting up straight but is used to describe how a **Dancer**
  has every part of their body arranged. 
* Through the **Dancer's** various **Connections** to the rest of the world,
  they find a **Balance** that allows them to maintain their body in their
  desired **Posture**. 
* **Balance** is the distribution of the **Dancer's** weight across the various
  **Points of Contact** that they currently have available to them through their **Connections**.  
* A **Center of Gravity** exists at all times for every **Dancer**. It is a point in space that represents where a **Dancer** must **Balance** around and support their weight through. If a **Dancer** cannot support their **Center of Gravity** through their **Balance**, they will lose their **Posture** and have a full body **Connection** with **The Floor**. 
* A **Dancer** can move their **Center of Gravity** around by changing their **Balance** and **Posture**. 
* During a **Partner Dance**, each **Dancer** has an **Orientation** towards the other **Dancer** irrespective of their **Posture** that describes how their body is positioned relative to the other person. The **Dancers** could be **Oriented** so that they were standing face to face to each other, side to side, or back to back, with any number of different **Postures** being taken by each **Dancer** without changing the **Orientation**. 
* A **Position** during a **Partner Dance** is when a **Leader** and a **Follower** have a specific **Orientation** to each other, a specific **Connection** between the two of them, and each their own specific **Posture**, **Balance**, and **Center of Gravity**.  
* A **Movement** is anything that changes the **Position** of the **Dancers**, typically initiated by the **Leader** and lead through the **Connection** between the two **Dancers**.
* A **Pattern** is a sequence of **Movements** that has the **Dancers** progress through a sequence of different **Positions**.
* A **Step** is a **Pattern** that starts and ends with the same **Position**, so it can be done back to back forever. 
* A **Song** is the specific **Music** that is playing at a given moment. 
* The **Beat** for a **Song** is the pace at which the **Song** moves. Metaphorically, it's the pulse of a heartbeat in the song.
* Each **Song** has a **Beat** and sometimes more than one as the tempo might change during the song. 
* Being **On Beat** means that the **Movements** the **Dancers** are doing have key moments in the movement that match the **Beat** of the **Song**. 

So now that I have some language with which to take about dancing I'll start
with where I am approaching connections in Bachata Sensual from. I've been
dancing since 2013 and have mostly focused on Salsa dancing, with some
performances done in On2 but much more time spent dancing socially On1. At 6'5",
I'm much taller than the typical dancer and so I basically wrote off getting
good at Bachata entirely. The height difference between me and most followers
was enough that the close dancing of Bachata just didn't seem possible for me in
a comfortable way. 

Jumping back into dancing after the pandemic got under control in 2022, I
started focusing on Bachata seriously for the first time. The DC/DMV Bachata
scene is great and full of wonderful dancers and I figured I understood dancing
well enough now that I could overcome the challenges presented by my height.
Bachata Sensual and it's body movement was what I had struggled with the most
when I tried it, so that was the one I focused on. 

After a couple months of taking classes, I think I understand what had been
throwing me off for so long about Bachata, in particular leading body movements.
Beyond just the height difference making connecting awkward, there is a holdover
from Salsa dancing that had tripped me up. In Bachata Sensual, you are
connecting with and moving the follower's center of gravity in a way that you
should not do when dancing Salsa. 

With Salsa, I never try to change the follower's center of gravity purposefully,
I just accept that they will have a certain balance on a certain beat of the
music and so that makes certain moves better to do than others in that moment. I
expect the follower to maintain their own balance, posture and step throughout
the dance for the most. I'm not an expert Salsa dancer though, so I won't claim
that that's a hard fast and rule, but just an observation based on my
experience. Dominican Bachata is similar to me, with the fast footwork. It still
has more body movement lead by the leader than Salsa for sure, but nothing like
Sensual. 

With Bachata Sensual, the lead is taking hold of the follower's center of
gravity and using their connection to modify it. The body roll in Bachata
Sensual is a whole meal the leader can give the follower for several songs in a
row, while the body roll is just a nice snack in Salsa that you throw in to show
off but too much of it would make you sick. 

In Salsa, the connection I have with my partner is about finding their center of
gravity, respecting it, and moving it around the dancer floor gracefully.
There's two types of beginner mistakes related to this in Salsa. The first is to
lead a spin too strongly and really trying to crank a spin out. Beyond
potentially hurting an unprepared follower's shoulder, most of the time this
sort of thing also throws off their center of gravity to the point where there
is no way for them to maintain balance and they lose their posture. The second
type of beginner mistake is the opposite, where you don't give a follower enough
energy through the lead for them to discern that you want them to spin. A lead
will put up their hand and wave it around weakly and expect the follower to turn
from that. There's no transfer of energy into the follower's body that tells
them to prepare to move around there center of gravity in the way the leader is
aiming for. 

Leading Salsa is about suggesting to the follower that they do certain moves
while respecting follower's balance and center of gravity while finding that
range of force in the connection that is comfortable for the follower while
still getting the point across. In Bachata Sensual, you still have to find that
good range of force and you are still suggesting that they do certain moves, but
the lead is consistently moving the follower's center of gravity through those
moves in a way that doesn't leave the follower much option besides changing
their posture, balance and center of gravity. 

The Bachata Sensual connection has a constant tension to it, so much so that
lessening the tension some is a way of pulling the follower forward at the
connection point. The expectation in the Sensual connection is that there is
always that constant level of tension once the leader has established it, so the
follower should chase the connection point if the lead lessens but does not
remove the tension there. 

The center of gravity for the follower in Bachata Sensual has a much wider range
that it travels more frequently than during a Salsa dance. Body rolls are taught
in the first couple classes for Sensual and you're expected to use and love
them. The follower's center of gravity is always orbiting around during the
dance, shifting back and forth as part of the moves.

Getting back more to the language I laid out above, there are a couple types of
connections that I've noticed that are worth talking about here more, because
they let me be more precise about what Sensual Bachata seems to be and what I'm
trying to learn. 

* A **Grounding Connection** is any connection you have with **The Floor**. It
  will always be there and support you no matter how much weight you want to put
  on it. You can put 100% of your weight into this without losing **Balance**. 
* An **Informing Connection** is one through which the **Lead** only conveys
  their intent to the follower about which moves to do next. After you move past
  being a beginner, a right hand turn out of a basic step is lead through an
  **Informing Connection** in Salsa. An **Informing Connection** does not change
  the **Balance** or **Center of Gravity** of the **Follower** directly, but
  does so indirectly by giving a signal through the **Modification** of the
  **Posture** of the **Follower** to do a certain **Movement**. 
* A **Stabilizing Connection** is one where the **Lead** offers stability
  through the **Connection** that helps the **Follower** maintain their
  **Balance** and **Center of Gravity**. For intermediates, this would come into
  play when a couple starts doing double spins in Salsa or some of the Off Axis
  turns in Zouk. This **Movement** should mostly come from the **Followers**
  prep and balance, but it's often important for the **Lead** to offer both
  extra power and stability to the **Follower** through their connection. The
  **Leader** is stabilizing the **Center of Gravity** of the **Follower**,
  changing their **Balance** so that **Center of Gravity** might remain the
  same. 
* A **Load-bearing Connection** is one in which a significant portion of the
  **Followers** weight is transferred through the **Connection** and onto the
  **Leader**. If the **Leader** were to remove their support, the **Follower**
  would not be able to maintain their **Balance** alone with that specific
  **Posture** and they would start to fall. Doing a **Dip** or a **Lean** takes
  a solid **Load-bearing connection**. Although it's typically a **Leader**
  supporting a **Follower**, [a classic counter example is the leans done in
  Cuban Son](https://youtu.be/gsKQalDu4VU?t=232). 
* Lastly, a **Modifying Connection** is when the **Leader** modifies the
  **Follower's** **Center of Gravity** directly. This means shifting the
  **Follower's** **Posture**, **Balance** and **Center of Gravity** all at once. 

All of these types of connections can be expressed from any connection, though
some connections are much better suited for particular purposes. You probably
shouldn't try to do a load bearing connection with just a right to right
connection through the fingertips, but hey, let me know if you figure out how to
make that work. And asides from the grounding connection, each of these types of
connections can flow into one another as the lead sees fit. 

In Salsa, you have the grounding, informing, stabilizing, and load-bearing
connections, but very few modifying connections. Or at least, the modifying to
the centers of gravity is much smaller than other dances and only moves around
horizontally and less vertically.

For Bachata Sensual though, you have all those connections plus the modifying
connection. What I've found difficult is that I know the gradient of force to
apply to indicate informing vs stabilizing vs load bearing in most dances, but
that gradient changes somehow when you put in a modifying connection. The
follower has lost their reluctance to lose their posture and will flow like silk
if they can. What I'm trying to learn is how to find the range of force needed
for a modifying connection for any particular person I might be dancing with.
I've been told I often veer into too strong with the lead for body movements
that need that modifying connection and so that's why I've been thinking about
all this. I imagine it'll click soon, now that I know what I am looking for and
what I already have, but this is a lot of my current thinking about dancing and
about all I have time to write up for today.
